	<!-- monitor the temperature and humidity in the house remotely via smart devices at all times.
		Homeowners can be alerted when the temperature exceeds a set threshold value.
		Homeowners can control the air-conditioner remotely via smart devices.

	Example:
	Homeowners can use a smart device to remotely turn on the air-conditioner
	(simulated by the fan) if the temperature is relatively high during the day in order to
	cool up the house before reaching home. -->
